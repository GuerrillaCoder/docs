## ServiceStack pre-release GitHub Feed

Our interim pre-release NuGet packages in between major releases on NuGet are published to [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/ServiceStack/packages).


### Requires GitHub Authentication

Since GitHub does not yet support anonymous access to public NuGet repositories, you will need to configure a GitHub [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `read:packages` permissions.

Once your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is created, you will need to add a `servicestack-github` NuGet Source into your NuGet.config. 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
    <add key="github-servicestack" value="https://nuget.pkg.github.com/ServiceStack/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
  <packageSourceCredentials>
        <github-servicestack>
            <add key="Username" value="GITHUB_USERNAME" />
            <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="TOKEN" />
        </github-servicestack>
    </packageSourceCredentials>
</configuration>
```

Your `packageSources` `key` needs to match the `packageSourceCredentials` element name

### Add using Mix

If you have the [dotnet x tool](/dotnet-tool) installed, you can configure your projects by downloading `NuGet.Config` in the same folder as your **.sln**

:::sh
x mix gh-nuget
:::


### Using GitHub Packages in GitHub Actions

To avoid checking in Tokens into your repositories, the GitHub Packages Registry should instead be added as a nuget source from the command-line where it has
access to your Repo's secrets. This will need to be added before building or publishing your .NET project, e.g:

**build.yml**

```yml
- name: Add pre-release packages source
  run: | 
    dotnet nuget add source "https://nuget.pkg.github.com/ServiceStack/index.json" --username ${{ github.actor }} --password ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} --store-password-in-clear-text --name github
- name: Build
  run: dotnet build
```

**release.yml**

```yml
# Publish .NET Project
- name: Publish dotnet project
  working-directory: ./MyApp
  run: | 
    dotnet nuget add source "https://nuget.pkg.github.com/ServiceStack/index.json" --username ${{ github.actor }} --password ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} --store-password-in-clear-text --name github
    dotnet publish -c Release
```


### Add using VS .NET

Instructions to add ServiceStack's GitHub feed to VS .NET are:

  1. Go to **Tools** > **Options** > **Nuget Package Manager** > **Package Sources**
  2. Add the Source `https://nuget.pkg.github.com/ServiceStack/index.json` with the name of your choice, 
  e.g. _servicestack-github_
  3. Enter your GitHub Username and Personal Access Token when prompted. 

![NuGet Package Sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/wikis/github-nuget-vs-dialog.png)

After registering the GitHub feed it will show up under NuGet package sources when opening the NuGet 
package manager dialog:

![NuGet Package Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/wikis/github-nuget-vs-manage.png)

Which will allow you to search and install pre-release packages from the selected GitHub feed.

:::info
You can configure your Package Source Credentials outside of Visual Studio via a NuGet.config.
Your NuGet.config should be located under `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.config` or `~/.nuget/NuGet/NuGet.config`
:::


### Adding GitHub feed without VS .NET

If you're not using or don't have VS .NET installed, you can add the GitHub feed to your NuGet.config at `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.config` or `~/.nuget/NuGet/NuGet.config`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
    <add key="github-servicestack" value="https://nuget.pkg.github.com/ServiceStack/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
  <packageSourceCredentials>
        <github-servicestack>
            <add key="Username" value="GITHUB_USERNAME" />
            <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="TOKEN" />
        </github-servicestack>
    </packageSourceCredentials>
</configuration>
```

## Redownloading GitHub packages

If you've already packages with the **same version number** from GitHub previously installed, you will 
need to manually delete the NuGet `/packages` folder for NuGet to pull down the latest packages.

### Clear NuGet Package Cache

You can clear your local NuGet packages cache in any OS by running the command-line below in your favorite Terminal:

:::sh
nuget locals all -clear
:::

If `nuget` is not in your Systems `PATH`, it can also be invoked from the `dotnet` tool:

:::sh
dotnet nuget locals all --clear
:::

Within VS .NET you can clear them from **Tools** > **Options** > **Nuget Package Manager** and click **Clear All NuGet Cache(s)**:

![Clear Packages Cache](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/wikis/myget/clear-package-cache.png)

Alternatively on Windows you can delete the Cached NuGet packages manually with:

:::sh
$ del %LOCALAPPDATA%\NuGet\Cache\*.nupkg /q
:::

### Full Package Clean

In most cases clearing the NuGet packages cache will suffice, sometimes you'll also need to manually delete other local packages caches

delete all NuGet packages in `/packages` folder:

:::sh
rd /q /s packages 
:::

delete `/bin` and `/obj` folders in host project

:::sh
rd /q /s bin obj
:::


## Versioning Scheme

All ServiceStack packages are published together in "lockstep" with the same version number so the effort to upgrade ServiceStack projects can be done all at same time, with low frequency. 

ServiceStack Versions adopt the following 3-part versioning scheme:

```
{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}
```

### Major versions 

The `{MAJOR}` is reserved for Major releases like [v5 containing structural changes](/releases/v5_0_0) that may require changes to external environment and/or project configurations. Major structural releases should be few and far between with currently no plans for any in the immediate future.

### Minor versions

The `{MINOR}` version is used for major ServiceStack official releases which will have a `{PATCH}` version of **0**.

#### Patch versions

The `{PATCH}` version is used to distinguish updates from normal releases where a `{PATCH}` above **0** indicates an Enhancement Release.

Whilst we want to minimize the effort for Customers to upgrade we also want to make any fixes or enhancements to the previous release available sooner as there are often fixes reported and resolved immediately after each release and made available in our **pre-release packages on GitHub** that most Customers wont get until the next major Release on NuGet. 

To deliver updates sooner we dedicate time immediately after each release to resolving issues and adding enhancements to existing features so we can publish update releases before starting work on new major features. Update releases will be primarily additive and minimally disruptive so they're safe to upgrade.

- An **even** `{PATCH}` version number indicates an "Update" release published to **NuGet**.
- An **odd** version number indicates a "pre-release" version that's only **available on GitHub**

Versioning scheme example:

  - **v5.0.0** - Current Major Release with structural changes
    - v5.0.2 - Enhancement of Major v5.0.0 Release
    - v5.0.3 - Pre-release packages published to GitHub only
    - v5.0.4? - Enhancement of Major v5.0.0 Release (if any)
  - **v5.1.0** - Next Major Release
    - v5.1.1 - Pre-release packages published to GitHub only
    - v5.1.2? - Enhancement of Major v5.1.0 Release (if any)
  - ...
  - **v6.0.0** - Next Major Release with structural changes
