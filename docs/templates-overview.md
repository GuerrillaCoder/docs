ServiceStack has its strong foundations as a Web and MQ Services framework whose [easy and versatile HTML support](https://razor.netcore.io/) makes it the ideal services framework to create Backend Systems and Web APIs, Websites, Single Page Apps, Windows Services, Self-Hosting Console Apps and Rich OSX and Winforms Desktop Apps.

[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack) (**J**avaScript, **A**PIs, and **M**arkup) is a modern architecture pattern to build fast, secure and easy to scale web applications where pre-rendering content, enhancing with JavaScript and leveraging CDN static hosting results in a highly productive, flexible and performant system that takes advantage of CDN edge caches to deliver **greater performance** & efficiency at **lower cost**. 

### Jamstack Benefits

It's quickly becoming the preferred architecture for modern web apps with 
[benefits](https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack/) extending beyond performance to improved: 

 - **Security** from a reduced attack surface from hosting read-only static resources and requiring fewer App Servers
 - **Scale** with non-essential load removed from App Servers to CDN's architecture capable of incredible scale & load capacity
 - **Maintainability** resulting from reduced hosting complexity and the clean decoupling of UI and server logic
 - **Portability** with your static UI assets being easily capable from being deployed and generically hosted from any CDN or web server
 - **Developer Experience** with major JavaScript Frameworks embracing Jamstack in their dev model, libraries & tooling  

Ultimately, it's hosting your App's pre-rendered static UI assets on Content Delivery Network (CDN) edge caches close to users locations that's primarily responsible for its lightning performance.

### Blazor WebAssembly

The [Blazor WebAssembly (WASM)](/templates-blazor) template offers a pure end-to-end integrated C# solution to building a high performance web application with [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and ServiceStack. Due to the integrated dev model we've been able to achieve in Blazor it's become **our preferred technology** to use to develop **Line of Business Apps** since it's the only C# Razor solution adopting our preferred [API First Development](/api-first-development) model with Web UIs reusing the same well-defined APIs as Mobile and Desktop Apps.

### Next.js

For those preferring working with **React**, there's a clear choice in Nextjs.org - currently the flagship & [most popular Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/) framework backed by the folks over at [Vercel](https://vercel.com), where it enjoys deep engineering talent committed to maintaining and continually improving it, so you can be confident in the longevity of the technology and the React framework maintained by [Meta](https://meta.com) (Facebook).

### Vite

Vite is being [built for speed](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) in the modern era and takes advantage of modern browser features like native ES modules support to remove bundling entirely during development and adopts performance leading technologies like [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) to pre-bundle dependencies and [transpile TypeScript](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#typescript) which is able to do **20-30x** faster than TypeScript's own `tsc` compiler.

Ultimately its architectural choices allows Vite to deliver Lightning Fast **Hot Module Reload** (HMR) to remain at the developer-experience forefront of modern web development serving a [growing ecosystem](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) of frameworks with a rich typed suite of [Universal Plugins](https://vitejs.dev/plugins/).

### Webpack-powered Single Page App Templates

All [ServiceStack Single Page App templates](/templates-single-page-apps) are powered by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) which handles the development, testing and production builds of your Web App. See the [Webpack Template Docs](/templates-single-page-apps) for an overview for how to utilize the templates features.

## Example Projects

The Example projects below contain a working demo including further documentation about each of their templates they were built with:

### TypeScript React Template

[TypeScript React Template](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-react-template/) incorporates today's best-in-class 
technologies for developing rich, complex JavaScript Apps within VS.NET and encapsulated within ServiceStack's new
[TypeScript React Template](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-react-template/)
providing an instant integrated client and .NET server solution where you'll be immediately productive 
out-of-the-box whilst enabling an optimal iterative development experience with pre-configured Gulp tasks 
that takes care of effortlessly packaging, bundling and deploying your next App. 

### React Desktop Apps

[React Desktop Apps](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/ReactDesktopApps) take advantage of the adaptability, navigation and deep-linking benefits of a Web-based UI, the productivity and responsiveness of the 
[React framework](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
the performance, rich features and functionality contained in 
[ServiceStack](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki) and the .NET Framework combined with the native experience and OS Integration possible from a Native Desktop App - all within a single VS .NET template!

### React App Template

The [ReactJS App Template](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/ReactChat) enables an optimal iterative dev experience for creating optimized Single Page React.js Apps. It shares the same approach for developing modern Single Page Apps in VS.NET as the [AngularJS App Template](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/blob/master/docs/angular-spa.md) by leveraging the node.js ecosystem for managing all aspects of Client App development and using the best-in-class libraries.

### AngularJS App Template

The [AngularJS App](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/blob/master/docs/angular-spa.md) template in [ServiceStackVS](/create-your-first-webservice) provides a modern opinionated web technology stack for developing rich Single Page Apps with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) and ServiceStack.

### [Integrated HTML, CSS and JavaScript Minifiers](/html-css-and-javascript-minification)

For normal server-generated websites that don't leverage Webpack to bundle their outputs you can take advantage of ServiceStack's integrated and non-invasive minification features to effortlessly enable [HTML, CSS and JavaScript minification to your existing Website](/html-css-and-javascript-minification).
